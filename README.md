# ethical-requirements-asm
This repository provides [ASMETA](https://asmeta.github.io/index.html) models (based on Abstract State Machines) and artifacts for the formal specification and well-formedness analysis of SLEEC ethical requirements, including conflict and redundancy detection.

It includes the two case studies:
- Firefighter UAV, tasked to tackle fires by interacting with human firefighters, bystanders and teleoperators;
- the Robotic Assistive Dressing (RAD) system, tasked with assisting a physically impaired user in daily dressing activities;
